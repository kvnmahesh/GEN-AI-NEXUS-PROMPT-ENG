## Matching Models to Report Sections

To optimize the automated report generation for **GEN AI NEXUS**, we mapped specific AI models to different sections of the requirement analysis report:

| Report Section        | Recommended Models                               | Purpose                                                     |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Overview**   | Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2                    | For generating coherent summaries and maintaining structured text. |
| **Data & Methodologies**| Mistral-large, Gemma2                           | To provide detailed and precise descriptions of data handling and methodologies. |
| **Results & Evaluation**| Qwen2, Microsoft/phi-4                          | For delivering structured metric analysis and clear presentation of findings. |
| **Discussion & Future Work** | Gemma2, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct    | To enhance reasoning and present well-rounded discussions and projections. |
| **Project Setup & Usage** | Codestral, Tinyllama                        | For producing structured documentation and step-by-step instructions. |
| **Appendices**          | Codestral, Qwen2                                | To generate code snippets and support extended textual explanations. |

## Results

| Model              | Prompt                                          | Response                                           | Time Taken |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Llama-3.2:latest   | "Provide a brief explanation of Newton's Third Law." | "Newton's Third Law states that 'for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.'" | 6.758s     |
| Llama-3.2:latest   | "What are the benefits of active recall in studying?" | Compared active learning with passive reading, highlighting improved retention and engagement. | 26.544s    |
| Llama-3.2:latest   | "What are the requirements for a personalized tutoring chatbot?" | Generated features like Personalized Study Plans, Adaptive Learning Algorithm. | 11.416s    |

### Comparison:
- Short and straightforward prompts led to quicker responses.
- Detailed prompts with multi-step reasoning improved the quality of answers but increased response time.
- **Best Performance:** Combining **Chain-of-Thought** with **Automated Prompt Generation** yielded the highest accuracy.

### Impact on GEN AI NEXUS:
- The bot generated more detailed and relevant requirements.

### Example:
When asked to create requirements for a "Quiz Module," the bot produced structured outputs like:
- "The bot should generate quizzes based on the student's current topic."
- "Quizzes should adapt to the studentâ€™s learning pace."
