    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "Passive reading is often confused with passive learning. Passive reading involves reading material without actively engaging with it, whereas passive learning occurs when we simply memorize information without truly understanding or applying it. On the other hand, active learning, which includes both learning and retaining information, involves a more direct approach to mastering new concepts.\n",

Active learning enhances learner outcomes in terms of retention rates, achievement, transfer, communication, collaboration, and satisfaction.\n",
